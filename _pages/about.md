CS @ UCLA | AI @ Camfer (YC S24) | Research @ UCLA NLP| GenAI @ Scale

Hello! I'm Clark, a Computer Science student at UCLA. I'm broadly interested in AI, and my recent work has been focused on building and aligning generative models.

Currently, I'm an intern at camfer (YC S24), where I'm fortunate to work with a brilliant team on building the world's first text-to-CAD foundation model. I focus on expanding our data coverage and evaluation capabilities, which involves everything from synthetically multiplying our existing datasets and integrating new CAD environments to building RL evaluation environments to benchmark and train our models.

This work builds on my interest in controlling generative models, which I've been fortunate to explore across different domains. At the UCLA NLP Group, I worked on benchmarking physical commonsense in video generation. At the HMC Music Retrieval Lab, I explored how to steer music models using techniques like DPO and self-distillation.

Outside of research, I try to stay involved with the AI community at UCLA. I lead our competitive ML team as an ACM AI Projects Officer, where we tackle Kaggle competitions and build projects together. When I have the time, I also enjoy making games!
