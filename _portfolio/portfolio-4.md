2024 Research Project. Idea originated from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/data).

In our research on time series event detection, we developed a regression-based approach that predicts probability densities at event locations instead of relying on traditional segmentation methods. Our approach outperforms traditional segmentation techniques across various state-of-the-art networks and datasets, offering a more precise solution for specific event detection tasks.
