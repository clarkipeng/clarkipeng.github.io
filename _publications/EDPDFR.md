In our research on time series event detection, we developed a regression-based approach that predicts probability densities at event locations instead of relying on traditional segmentation methods. Our approach outperforms traditional segmentation techniques across various state-of-the-art networks and datasets, offering a more precise solution for specific event detection tasks.
